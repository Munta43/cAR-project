The 3D image of the car will be projected into a real life space using the rear phone camera allowing users to be able to walk around it and even hear the sounds of the engine. This application can help users see a life size version of the car and allow them to see if it can fit in their garage/driveway. Users can listen to the sounds of the engine.
